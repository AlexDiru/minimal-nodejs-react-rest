# Minimal React and Node.js REST Example

React component accesses a JSON endpoint served by node.js with Express

```
node app.js
```

The key files are:

`app.js` - the back end
`index.html` - the front end

Runs on port 3000, just go to localhost:3000 for the html page to load. The html page loads a JSON object from localhost:3000/json and renders it
